Jpcap is an open source library for capturing and sending network packets from Java applications. It provides facilities to:

1. capture raw packets live from the wire. 

2. save captured packets to an offline file, and read captured packets from an offline file.

3. automatically identify packet types and generate corresponding Java objects (for Ethernet, IPv4, IPv6, ARP/RARP, TCP, UDP, and ICMPv4 packets).

4. filter the packets according to user-specified rules before dispatching them to the application.

5.send raw packets to the network
